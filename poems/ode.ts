    text: "\"Ruin seize thee, ruthless King!\nConfusion on thy banners wait,\nTho' fann'd by Conquest's crimson wing\nThey mock the air with idle state.\nHelm, nor hauberk's twisted mail,\nNor even thy virtues, tyrant, shall avail\nTo save thy secret soul from nightly fears,\nFrom Cambria's curse, from Cambria's tears!\"\nSuch were the sounds, that o'er the crested pride\nOf the first Edward scatter'd wild dismay,\nAs down the steep of Snowdon's shaggy side\nHe wound with toilsome march his long array.\nStout Glo'ster stood aghast in speechless trance;\nTo arms! cried Mortimer, and couch'd his quiv'ring lance.\n\nOn a rock, whose haughty brow\nFrowns o'er old Conway's foaming flood,\nRob'd in the sable garb of woe,\nWith haggard eyes the poet stood;\n(Loose his beard, and hoary hair\nStream'd, like a meteor, to the troubled air)\nAnd with a master's hand, and prophet's fire,\nStruck the deep sorrows of his lyre;\n\"Hark, how each giant-oak, and desert cave,\nSighs to the torrent's awful voice beneath!\nO'er thee, O King! their hundred arms they wave,\nRevenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breathe;\nVocal no more, since Cambria's fatal day,\nTo high-born Hoel's harp, or soft Llewellyn's lay.\n\n\"Cold is Cadwallo's tongue,\nThat hush'd the stormy main;\nBrave Urien sleeps upon his craggy bed:\nMountains, ye mourn in vain\nModred, whose magic song\nMade huge Plinlimmon bow his cloud-topp'd head.\nOn dreary Arvon's shore they lie,\nSmear'd with gore, and ghastly pale:\nFar, far aloof th' affrighted ravens sail;\nThe famish'd eagle screams, and passes by.\nDear lost companions of my tuneful art,\nDear, as the light that visits these sad eyes,\nDear, as the ruddy drops that warm my heart,\nYe died amidst your dying country's cries—\nNo more I weep. They do not sleep.\nOn yonder cliffs, a griesly band,\nI see them sit, they linger yet,\nAvengers of their native land:\nWith me in dreadful harmony they join,\nAnd weave with bloody hands the tissue of thy line:—\n\n\"'Weave the warp, and weave the woof,\nThe winding sheet of Edward's race.\nGive ample room, and verge enough\nThe characters of hell to trace.\nMark the year, and mark the night,\nWhen Severn shall re-echo with affright\nThe shrieks of death, thro' Berkley's roofs that ring,\nShrieks of an agonising King!\nShe-Wolf of France, with unrelenting fangs,\nThat tear'st the bowels of thy mangled mate,\nFrom thee be born, who o'er thy country hangs\nThe scourge of Heav'n. What terrors round him wait!\nAmazement in his van, with Flight combin'd,\nAnd Sorrow's faded form, and Solitude behind.\n\n\"'Mighty victor, mighty lord,\nLow on his funeral couch he lies!\nNo pitying heart, no eye, afford\nA tear to grace his obsequies.\nIs the Sable Warrior fled?\nThy son is gone. He rests among the dead.\nThe swarm, that in thy noon-tide beam were born?\nGone to salute the rising Morn.\nFair laughs the Morn, and soft the Zephyr blows,\nWhile proudly riding o'er the azure realm\nIn gallant trim the gilded vessel goes;\nYouth on the prow, and Pleasure at the helm;\nRegardless of the sweeping Whirlwind's sway,\nThat, hush'd in grim repose, expects his evening prey.\n\n\"'Fill high the sparkling bowl,\nThe rich repast prepare;\nReft of a crown, he yet may share the feast.\nClose by the regal chair\nFell Thirst and Famine scowl\nA baleful smile upon their baffled guest.\nHeard ye the din of battle bray,\nLance to lance, and horse to horse?\nLong years of havoc urge their destin'd course\nAnd thro' the kindred squadrons mow their way.\nYe towers of Julius, London's lasting shame,\nWith many a foul and midnight murther fed,\nRevere his consort's faith, his father's fame,\nAnd spare the meek usurper's holy head.\nAbove, below, the rose of snow,\nTwined with her blushing foe, we spread:\nThe bristled Boar in infant-gore\nWallows beneath the thorny shade.\nNow, brothers, bending o'er th' accursed loom\nStamp we our vengeance deep, and ratify his doom.\n\n\"'Edward, lo! to sudden fate\n(Weave we the woof. The thread is spun)\nHalf of thy heart we consecrate.\n(The web is wove. The work is done.)'\nStay, oh stay! nor thus forlorn\nLeave me unbless'd, unpitied, here to mourn!\nIn yon bright track, that fires the western skies!\nThey melt, they vanish from my eyes.\nBut oh! what solemn scenes on Snowdon's height\nDescending slow their glitt'ring skirts unroll?\nVisions of glory, spare my aching sight,\nYe unborn Ages, crowd not on my soul!\nNo more our long-lost Arthur we bewail.\nAll-hail, ye genuine kings, Britannia's issue, hail!\n\n\"Girt with many a baron bold\nSublime their starry fronts they rear;\nAnd gorgeous dames, and statesmen old\nIn bearded majesty appear.\nIn the midst a form divine!\nHer eye proclaims her of the Briton-line;\nHer lion-port, her awe-commanding face,\nAttemper'd sweet to virgin-grace.\nWhat strings symphonious tremble in the air,\nWhat strings of vocal transport round her play!\nHear from the grave, great Taliessin, hear;\nThey breathe a soul to animate thy clay.\nBright Rapture calls, and soaring, as she sings,\nWaves in the eye of Heav'n her many-colour'd wings.\n\n\"The verse adorn again\nFierce War, and faithful Love,\nAnd Truth severe, by fairy Fiction drest.\nIn buskin'd measures move\nPale Grief, and pleasing Pain,\nWith Horror, tyrant of the throbbing breast.\nA voice, as of the cherub-choir,\nGales from blooming Eden bear;\nAnd distant warblings lessen on my ear,\nThat lost in long futurity expire.\nFond impious man, think'st thou, yon sanguine cloud,\nRais'd by thy breath, has quench'd the orb of day?\nTo-morrow he repairs the golden flood,\nAnd warms the nations with redoubled ray.\nEnough for me: with joy I see\nThe different doom our Fates assign.\nBe thine Despair, and scept'red Care,\nTo triumph, and to die, are mine.\"\nHe spoke, and headlong from the mountain's height\nDeep in the roaring tide he plung'd to endless night.",
