  description:
    "A pantoum is a form of poetry that originated in Malaysia and is characterized by its specific structure and repetitive nature. It consists of a series of quatrains (four-line stanzas) in which the second and fourth lines of each stanza are repeated as the first and third lines of the next stanza. This pattern continues throughout the poem, creating a circular and interlocking effect.",

    text: "My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains\nMy sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,\nOr emptied some dull opiate to the drains\nOne minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:\n'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,\nBut being too happy in thine happiness,—\nThat thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees\nIn some melodious plot\nOf beechen green, and shadows numberless,\nSingest of summer in full-throated ease.\n\nO, for a draught of vintage! that hath been\nCool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,\nTasting of Flora and the country green,\nDance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!\nO for a beaker full of the warm South,\nFull of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,\nWith beaded bubbles winking at the brim,\nAnd purple-stained mouth;\nThat I might drink, and leave the world unseen,\nAnd with thee fade away into the forest dim:\n\nFade far away, dissolve, and quite forget\nWhat thou among the leaves hast never known,\nThe weariness, the fever, and the fret\nHere, where men sit and hear each other groan;\nWhere palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,\nWhere youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;\nWhere but to think is to be full of sorrow\nAnd leaden-eyed despairs,\nWhere Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,\nOr new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.\n\nAway! away! for I will fly to thee,\nNot charioted by Bacchus and his pards,\nBut on the viewless wings of Poesy,\nThough the dull brain perplexes and retards:\nAlready with thee! tender is the night,\nAnd haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,\nCluster'd around by all her starry Fays;\nBut here there is no light,\nSave what from heaven is with the breezes blown\nThrough verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.\n\nI cannot see what flowers are at my feet,\nNor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,\nBut, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet\nWherewith the seasonable month endows\nThe grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;\nWhite hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;\nFast fading violets cover'd up in leaves;\nAnd mid-May's eldest child,\nThe coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,\nThe murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.\n\nDarkling I listen; and, for many a time\nI have been half in love with easeful Death,\nCall'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme,\nTo take into the air my quiet breath;\nNow more than ever seems it rich to die,\nTo cease upon the midnight with no pain,\nWhile thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad\nIn such an ecstasy!\nStill wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain—\nTo thy high requiem become a sod.\n\nThou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!\nNo hungry generations tread thee down;\nThe voice I hear this passing night was heard\nIn ancient days by emperor and clown:\nPerhaps the self-same song that found a path\nThrough the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,\nShe stood in tears amid the alien corn;\nThe same that oft-times hath\nCharm'd magic casements, opening on the foam\nOf perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.\n\nForlorn! the very word is like a bell\nTo toll me back from thee to my sole self!\nAdieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well\nAs she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf.\nAdieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades\nPast the near meadows, over the still stream,\nUp the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep\nIn the next valley-glades:\nWas it a vision, or a waking dream?\nFled is that music:—Do I wake or sleep?",

    "Choose a theme or subject: Select a theme or subject for your pantoum. It could be a personal experience, an emotion, a natural scene, or any other topic that inspires you. Having a clear focus will help guide your writing.",
    "Determine the rhyme scheme: Decide on the rhyme scheme for your pantoum. Typically, the second and fourth lines of each quatrain will be repeated as the first and third lines of the next quatrain. You can represent the rhyme scheme as ABAB, BCBC, CDCD, and so on.",
    "Write the first quatrain: Start by writing the first quatrain of your pantoum. Choose two rhyming lines and two non-rhyming lines. These non-rhyming lines will become the repeated lines in subsequent stanzas. Ensure that the quatrain conveys a coherent thought or image related to your chosen theme.",
    "Repeat and expand: Take the second and fourth lines from the first quatrain and use them as the first and third lines of the second quatrain. Write two new lines to complete the second quatrain, ensuring they rhyme with each other. This creates a sense of continuity and expansion as the poem progresses.",
    "Continue the pattern: Repeat the process for subsequent quatrains. Take the second and fourth lines of the previous quatrain and use them as the first and third lines of the next quatrain. Write two new lines that rhyme with each other to complete the quatrain. This creates the repetitive structure of the pantoum.",
    "Conclude the pantoum: End your pantoum with a final quatrain that repeats the second and fourth lines from the previous stanza. The final quatrain should provide a sense of closure or a resolution related to your chosen theme.",
    "Revise and refine: After writing the initial draft of your pantoum, review the poem for clarity, coherence, and poetic effect. Pay attention to the flow, rhythm, and rhyme scheme. Make any necessary adjustments to enhance the overall structure and impact of the pantoum.",
    "Read aloud and seek feedback: Read your pantoum aloud to assess its rhythm and flow. Listen to how the repeated lines create a sense of connection and progression. Consider sharing your pantoum with others and gather feedback on its effectiveness. Revise further based on the feedback received.",
    "Finalize and polish: Make the final adjustments to your pantoum, ensuring that it maintains the repetitive structure and effectively conveys your chosen theme. Pay attention to grammar, punctuation, and formatting to present the pantoum in its best possible form.",
