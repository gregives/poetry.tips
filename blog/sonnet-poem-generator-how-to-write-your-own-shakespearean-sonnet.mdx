## What is a Sonnet Poem?

2. Use iambic pentameter: Most sonnets, including Shakespearean sonnets, are written in iambic pentameter. This means that each line consists of ten syllables, with a pattern of unstressed and stressed syllables.
3. Choose a rhyme scheme: A Shakespearean sonnet follows a rhyme scheme of ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. This means that the first and third lines of each quatrain rhyme, as do the second and fourth lines. The final couplet usually has a separate rhyme scheme.
4. Experiment with language: Sonnets are known for their poetic language, so don't be afraid to experiment with different words, phrases, and metaphors to create a beautiful and meaningful poem.
