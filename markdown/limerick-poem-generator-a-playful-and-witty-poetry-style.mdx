## What is a Limerick Poem?

A limerick is a form of poetry that consists of five lines with a distinctive rhyming pattern. The first, second, and fifth lines rhyme with each other, while the third and fourth lines rhyme with each other. Limericks are often humorous and playful, with a bouncy and upbeat rhythm.

## How to Write a Limerick Poem

Writing a limerick is easier than you might think. Here’s a simple formula to follow:

1. Choose a topic or theme for your poem.
2. Write the first line, which should introduce the topic and end with a rhyme.
3. Write the second line, which should also rhyme with the first line and continue the topic.
4. Write the third and fourth lines, which should rhyme with each other and provide a twist or surprise in the poem.
5. Write the fifth line, which should rhyme with the first two lines and provide a satisfying conclusion to the poem.

Here’s an example of a limerick:

There once was a man from Peru,
Whose hair grew and grew and grew,
He combed it each day,
In a magnificent way,
And now it’s the talk of the zoo.
